# BC Radio
infinite stream of bandcamp content through your browser.

## How?
Install Go (https://golang.org/), then install the single dependency from the command line `go get github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery`, and finally `go build main.go`.
Start the resulting executable, and open your browser to `localhost:8080`. Enter one or more keywords/tags/genres and bcradio will automatically start streaming music. No need to interact with it after that, the stream will continue forever.
